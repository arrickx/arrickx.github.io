# A little bit about myself ðŸš€

## Background
I started my journey in software engineering not with a bang, but with a quiet "what if?" While working in the banking sector, I noticed that the app they were using had a lot of room for improvement, and I said to myself, "If I were the one building it, I could make it better." This sparked my interest in coding. I began to learn by myself, and my interest grew into a desire to use my tech skills to give back, to help spark creativity and bring people together.

## Turning point
When the pandemic hit, it became crystal clear to me that technology wasnâ€™t just a hobbyâ€”it was a powerful tool for bringing people together and making a difference. To make it a clear statement, I joined Codesmith, an intensive bootcamp that sharpened both my technical and collaborative abilities. 
Iâ€™ve worked on open-source projects and with non-profits, which has helped me become really good at working with all kinds of people and explaining complex ideas in ways everyone can understand. Iâ€™ve worked on both the front end and the back end, as well as on testing, so Iâ€™m ready for any challenge that comes my way.


## One more thing
My goal is to use my tech skills to give back, to help spark creativity and bring people together. Iâ€™m currently diving into Design Patterns and Generative AI, and exploring some interesting ideas.
